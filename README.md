# Bot-
We are making a bot for helping students for the problems regarding three platforms teams,moodle and impartus.

Some pdf related to assignments,tutorials,quizzes,lectures slides are uploaded on impartus,some on teams,and some on moodle.

This makes some confusion for a student where to find them at initial stage of courses.

So we are making a bot which can provide links for those.

This project will be created by Vatsal Jingar,Anshul Nagdeve,Aashish Aggarwal.

This project is created for Hackathon for students of IIT-D.
